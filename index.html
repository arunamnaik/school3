        <p>"I am not just an edifice set in stone
            Nor a horde of tutors that merely students I will hone
            I am not just your set of run-of-the-mill books
            Or a mirror to divulge how your future looks
            You may find me ordinary sometimes … but lackluster is never me
            Your perception of me, however, is a reflection of you in me to see
            I am a source of infinite energy that binds my dynamic universe
            Choose to repel, remark or revel in my facade diverse
            I am the progressive verve that sees the unseen
            I sense the elusive and achieve the never-been
            I am an endless source of vitality
            I am the infinite reality!
            I am me!
            I am the Future Kids School."
            When asked what motivated her to start FKS, Ms. Shailaja Rao, The Prime Mover of The Future Kid’s School (FKS), responded that she had the “benefit of the worst teachers.”
            She was the victim of teacher discouragement and rebuke while in school. All she wanted to do in her lifetime was to create a place of learning which the child would cherish, look forward to going every day. She wanted to build an institution where every child was understood for who she or he was. This, Shailaja wanted to achieve by moving away from conventional methods of teaching.
            In 1997, a dream was born in Hyderabad. A 4,000 sq. ft. of rented space housed 20 eager minds, one teacher and 5 support staff. The dream was christened The Future Kid’s School. This dream grew steadily and by 2005, FKS had over 650 children, 65 teachers and 55 support staff to make it a one big family.
            Today, in 2021, it stands tall and proud. Three campuses host over 2,200 students, 200+ teachers, over 270 support staff, a kitchen that feeds around 3,000 members every day and plies 73 school buses.</p>
